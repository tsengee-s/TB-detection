Problem:
Tuberculosis is one of the leading infectious causes of death worldwide. Unfortunately, delays in diagnosis are common, especially in resource-limited settings, and can worsen individual outcomes and perpetuate transmission of the disease.

Solution:
An automated algorithm that could reliably detect mycobacterium on samples from patients with suspected TB would lead to more accurate and timely diagnosis of active TB in many places that currently have barriers to both.
